# Mothra

This will be a Django/Python API with a React frontend project for tracking bugs.

## Installing Flask

1. Verify that Python is installed on your machine and Scripts are enabled (If on Windows, open cmd and type 'powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned')
2. In an open terminal, cd to the root of the project (Mothra/)
3. type 'python -m venv venv'. This should create a new directory in Mothra/venv
4. execute 'venv/Scripts/activate'
5. execute 'pip install -r requirments.txt'
6. cd into 'Mothra/backend-flask' and type 'flask run'
   The flask server should start running on 127.0.0.1:5000/

start windev
